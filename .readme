## About

The goal of this project is to provide an all around solution for hosting a photo website on a low budget machine.

### Included

  - /albums - lists out all of the folders in a "photos" folder

  - /albums/{album}/{photo} - serves a specific photo
  - /static/{file} - serves a static ui
- Angular UI
  - Integrates with the Rust webserver
  - Displays thumbnails for all of the albums
  - Click on a thumbnail to see the rest of the photos
  - Allows copy url of album to share direct links to albums

### Hardware
